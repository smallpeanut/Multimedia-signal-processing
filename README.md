# Multimedia-signal-processing
The MSP folder will contain the MATLAB code of classical speech signal processing and classical image processing.

For MSP learning, I learned to use MATLAB to process speech signals and image signals.

For the speech signal, I completed the extraction of the feature parameters of the speech signal, compressed the speech signal using LPC linear prediction, and understood the principle of speech recognition technology.

For the image signal, I used MATLAB to achieve the basic image type conversion, edge sharpening, a variety of edge detection algorithms and GUI user interface design.
